# Week 1: Contemporary Relevance of Ethics
### Socrates
- Asserted that people only do wrong due to ignorance > **No one errs willingly** 
- Wrongdoing is not a deliberate choice but a result of not knowing what is right
- Therefore, virtuous behaviour stems from understanding good and right
## Ethics vs Morals
##### Moral
- What people believe is right and how we should behave; they are about personal behaviour
- Conceptual foundations and rational consistency of such standards are the subject matter of the philosophical discipline, namely, _ethics_
##### Ethics
- **A set of standards/moral principles** that control or influence a person's behaviour, the **discipline** concerned with what is morally good and bad and morally right and wrong
### Methodology of Ethical Reasoning
With ethics, we can **distill moral truth** by reasoning and can better **determine what is the right thing to do in each situation**
1. Meta-Ethics: What does "goodness mean?"
2. Normative level: What should I do? What ought to be the appropriate ethical conduct in a given situation?
3. Descriptive Ethics: scientific inquiry describing what happens in the real world, how do people actually behave? Also seeks to describe the ethical norms of a given community
### Normative Approach
Premise 1: X promised to purchase machines from Y (factual)
Premise 2: We ought to keep all our promises (normative)
Conclusion X: X ought to purchase machines from Y (normative)
- Is Premise 1 accurate? > are the facts correct
- Is Premise 2 valid? > are there alternative normative/moral propositions?
### Ethics, Personal Biases, and Emotions
**Principle of Consistency and Impartiality**
- Impartiality demands that decision-makers treat the affected persons in an equal and fair manner

> Ethical reasoning requires that we act consistently in similar circumstances but to what extent does our personal biases and emotions affect our judgements and decision-making?
### The "Moral Actor"
- Takes into account both **rational** and **emotional** perspective
- Appreciates the **situational** context
- Awareness of potential **biases**
- Intrinsic morality: sympathy, sense of fairness, self-control, sense of duty
### Ethics and Law
- Law is the means by which society imposes/enforces standards and expectations upon stakeholders
- But obeying the law **is not enough to fulfil ethical responsibilities**
##### Positive Law
- "man made law"
- defined by statute and common law and may or may not reflect natural law
- Example: highway speed limits, age requirement for purchasing alcohol
##### Natural Law
- theory that says human beings possess **intrinsic values that govern their reasoning and behaviour**
- maintains that these rules of right and wrong are **inherent in people** and are not created by society or court judges
#### Types of Regulation and Norms
- Rules (i.e., prohibitions, bans, etc.)
- Economic instruments (i.e., tax incentives)
- Guidelines / Codes of conduct / soft law
- Ethics and Moral Standards
### Ethics and Business
#### Adam Smith 
- The conditions of a competitive market, self-interest alone would lead, "as if by an invisible hand", to ethically appropriate ends (*The Wealth of Nations*)
- Sympathy, humanity, generosity, and benevolence are the most fundamental of all human motivations (*The Theory of Moral Sentiments*)
#### Milton Friedman
"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits"
- to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud
##### Criticism of Friedman
- Another way of seeing business is to consider **business as part of society** - not separate from society; acceptable standards of business behaviour are drawn from society rather than having opposing standards within business and society
- The pursuit of self-interest has been over-emphasised at the expense of other factors
# Week 2: Normative Ethics
## Utilitarianism (Jeremy Bentham) 
Utilitarian ethics: morality of an action depends on its **utility**
Major components: 
- The Principle of Consequences
- The Hedonistic Principle / Pleasure Principle (calculus)
- The Universalistic Principle
- The Principle of Utility

The result or the consequence of an act is the measure of **whether an act is good or bad - "consequentialist approach"**
How do we quantify happiness? Bentham suggests to do so by looking at certain factors [Hedonistic Calculus]
#### Hedonistic Calculus
| Factor |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Intensity | How strong it is |
| Duration | How long it is |
| Certainty | How likely it could be |
| Propinquity | When it could arrive |
| Fecundity | Will the pleasure lead to other pleasure |
| Purity | How free from pain is it |
| Extent | How many people are affected |
### Objections to Bentham's Calculus
- Determining the extent and scope of those affected is challenging
- Pain and pleasure are difficult to determine, measure, and compare
- The basis for calculating the hedonistic calculus is vague (based on probabilities)
- The question arises whether all pleasures should be given equal consideration (including anti-social, destructive, or sadistic pleasures)
### John Stuart Mill
He did not reject utilitarianism but sought to "humanise" the utilitarian calculus
For him, it's possible for a utilitarian to **distinguish higher from lower pleasures**
- believed that some pleasures are qualitatively higher than others
- to enjoy higher pleasures, cultivation and education is required
- mental pleasures are higher than physical because only humans can have them
- community and welfare interest
- if we do justice and if we respect rights, **society will be better off in the long run**
### Act and Rule Utilitarianism
| Act Utilitarianism (Jeremy Bentham)                                                                        | Rule Utilitarianism (John Stuart Mill)                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Looks at the **consequences of each individual act** and calculates utility each time the act is performed | Looks at the consequences of having everyone follow a **particular rule** and calculates the **overall utility** of accepting or rejecting the rule |
| The actual consequences for **each action** are considered                                                 |                                                                                                                                                     |
## Libertarianism
- Individual rights and freedoms are fundamental
- Libertarians consider individuals as being separate and not available to any use the society might desire
- Each of us has a fundamental right to liberty - the right to do whatever we want with the things we own, provided we respect other people’s rights to do the same
- **Principle of self-ownership, Personal autonomy**
#### Robert Nozick
- What makes income distribution just?
	- **P. of Just Original Acquisitions** (initial holdings) (e.g., someone discovers an uninhabited island and starts living there, they can claim ownership of it under this principle.)
	- **P. of Just Transfer** (free market) (e.g., buy a car from others in free market)
	- **P. of Rectification** (if the first two are violated, this is used to fix it)
- Entitlement theory
- There is a **fundamental right to liberty**
- The resulting view on government:
	- No paternalistic legislation
	- No morals legislation
	- No redistribution of income or wealth from the rich to the poor
### Taxation - Fair or Not?
Nozick argues that **taxation is theft** and is morally equivalent to forced labour and slavery because taxation is taking away the fruits of someone's labour
- against and violates the principles of self-ownership and the right to liberty
### Principle of Self-Possession
If we lack control of our earnings, we lack control of our labour. That is, we don't fully own ourselves
##### Extreme Cases
- Selling kidneys
- Voluntary assisted dying
- Consensual cannibalism
### Markets and Morals
The use case for free markets typically rests on two claims:
- Liberty (libertarianism)
- Welfare (Utilitarisnism)

Market choices are not always as free as they seem
- Certain good and social practices are corrupted or degraded if bought and sold for money
- The marketisation of everything sharpens the string of **inequality**
# Week 3: Normative Ethics
## Immanuel Kant
- Key fundamental ideas: human reason and freedom (Reason & Autonomy)
	- We are all **rational beings** (we are capable of reason)
	- We are also **autonomous beings** (we can act and choose)
- argues that morality is based neither on the principle of utility nor on a law of nature but on human reason. As per Kant, reason tells us what we ought to do, and when we obey our own reason, only then we are truly free
- critique of utilitarianism
	- Kant's philosophy offers a basis for (universal) human rights
	- Everyone has an inherent dignity
#### Against Utilitarianism
- People are no means to other people's happiness
- The utilitarian calculus leaves rights vulnerable
- Thinking about morality from the desires we happen to have is a wrong approach
- Morality cannot be based on empirical considerations, such as interests, wants, desires, and preferences, ... because these factors are variable and contingent
- Utilitarianism does not teach us how to distinguish right from wrong, but only to become better at calculation
#### Kant's Ethical Philosophy is based on our...
- **Capacity for reason**: we are rational beings
- **Capacity for freedom**: we are autonomous beings
Kant accepts that human beings have a capacity to feel **pleasure and pain**, but it is wrong that they are "sovereign masters"
### What is Moral?
- The motive of duty confers moral worth in an action, doing the right thing for the right reason
- Acting out of duty $\neq$ acting out of self interest, wants, desires, preferences, appetites, passions
- **No action can be moral if it is motivated by self interest, wants, desires, preferences, appetites, or passions**
- The only good is goodwill
- Kant sees human beings as rational beings who have the ability to **follow their duty**
#### What is the Moral Law?
**Categorical Imperative**
- Something that you must always do no matter the situation, no matter what you want to achieve or what you desire

**Hypothetical Imperative**
- Something that you must do in order to get something else (if you want X, then you do Y)
### What is Kant's Categorical Imperative?
**The formula of the Universal Law**
- Act only on that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become universal law
- Here "categorical" for Kant, means "unconditional"

**The formula of humanity as an end**
- Act in such as way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end

> **Is suicide against Kant's view?**
> Not ethical as if I end my life to escape a painful condition, I use myself as a means for the relief of my own suffering
### Testing Kant: The Murderer at the Door Dilemma
Imagine you are in a situation where you are hiding a person in your home who is being pursued by a murderer. The murderer, unaware of the person's presence in your house, comes to your door and asks whether the person is inside
- Utilitarian: Lie, to protect a life
- Kant: Lying is inherently immoral and it is the "duty to tell the truth"
#### Critiques Against Kant
- Overemphasis on duty and complete disregard of outcome
- Context and situations are relevant factors
- His theory is too logical / too rational, thereby not taking into account human emotion
### Kant and Society
- Rejects utilitarian approaches also for law-making and societal decision-making
- Maximising utility must never interfere with basic human rights
- Favours a theory of justice based on a social contract
- But Kant did not specify what principles of justice should be part of that contract
### Kant's Summary
![|600](images/Pasted%20image%2020240125095819.png)
## Aristotle
- Virtue Ethics: focuses not on what goodness is; it is "how to be a good man" (actions speak louder than words)
- Aristotle regarded ethics and politics as two related but separate fields of study
### Virtue Ethics
- **Justice is Teleological** > Defining rights requires us to figure out the _telos_ (the purpose, end, or essential nature)
- **Justice is Honorific** > To reason about the _telos_ of a practice - or to argue about it - is at least in part, to reason or argue about what virtues it should honour and reward
#### Moral Desert vs Virtue Ethics
##### Moral Desert
- is a condition of deserving something good or bad
- People should receive good outcomes if they perform good outcomes and bad outcomes if they perform bad actions. 
- **is about what individuals deserve based on their moral actions or character**
##### Virtue Ethics
- focuses on **human character, actions**, or practices
- is one can become more virtuous by **learning and experience**
- learning by doing to develop the right habits
- is based on **teleological thinking**
#### Teleological Thinking
- **"Theory of Causation"** - everything in nature works towards a _telos_ (an end/purpose)
- _**"Eudaimonia" (happiness)**_ - full satisfaction and complete [more about flourishing and fulfilling one's potential as a human being. It's generated through virtuous activities in our lifetime. Cf. utilitarianism=net balance/pain/pleasure]
- **"Practical wisdom"** - the ability to make informed and rational decisions, and to weigh between what is good or bad for man
#### Vices and Virtues
**Doctrine of The Mean**
- Virtue Ethics focuses on developing good character traits (virtues) and avoiding bad ones (vices)
- It teaches that each virtue lies between two vices, one of excess and one of deficiency and that moral virtue involves finding and maintaining this balance in various aspects of life
### Limitations of Virtue Ethics
- tends to be vague, does not tell us what to do
- "Practical Wisdom" is vague and subjective
- Defining the purpose of a thing, a person, a corporation, etc. - is a flexible exercise that is prone to subjectivity (and allows the recourse to experience, reflection, and social support, etc.)
## Confucian Ethics 
- widely accepted that Confucian ethics is a form of virtue ethics 
- **Purpose**: "The superior man learns in order to attain to the utmost of his principles" 「君子學以致其道」
- **Poise**: "The superior man in his thought does not go out of his place." It highlights acting within one's societal role to maintain harmony and balance, key to Confucian ethics of proper conduct and social order「君子思不出其位」
- **Self-sufficiency**: "What the superior man seeks, is in himself; what the ordinary man seeks, is in others" 「君子求诸己，小人求诸人 」
- "The superior man is aware of righteousness, the inferior man is aware of advantage" 「君子喻於義，小人喻於利。」
- "What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others" 「己所不欲，勿施於人」"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" - The Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12, Luke 6:31)

> Confucius (and also Mencius) both do not believe in treating every person equally. Rather, it would depend on the relationship between the parties, ranging from intimate family relations to less intimate relationships with strangers

## John Rawls 
- criticised utilitarianism
- _A Theory of Justice_ (1971)
- **Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice"** that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. The rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests
### The Original Position
- Rawls considers justice as fairness
- He argued that we get a better sense of good social outcomes if we focus on the idea of "procedural justice"
- The Original Position is a hypothetical **contractual situation** in which people of equal ability decide to agree on principles of social cooperation without knowing how anybody is placed in society
- **All contracting parties are equal** (none has more information or bargaining power than any other)
- The purpose of the thought experiment is to **find an objective point of view**
- The principles selected are enshrined in a contract that is then **binding** for all parties (social contract)
### Principles of Justice
#### The Equal Basic Liberty Principle 
- every individual should have the most extensive liberties and rights compatible with the same rights and liberties for all (e.g., freedom of thought, speech, expression, religion)
#### The Second Principle
- **The Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle** asserts that individuals should have equal access to opportunities regardless of their social or economic backgrounds
- **The Difference Principle** states that inequalities in society are acceptable only if they result in improving the well-being of the least advantaged members
### The Difference Principle
- governs the distribution of income and wealth, positions of responsibility and power, and the social bases of self-respect. It holds that **inequalities in the distribution of these goods are permissible only if they benefit the least well-off positions in society**
### A Theory of Justice - Recap
- John Rawls offers a novel version of the **social contract**
- He argues that the way to think about justice is to ask what **principles** we would agree to **if we did not know our place in society, our class, race, gender, or religion**
- If we thought about justice without knowing whether we would be rich or poor, healthy or frail, a banker or a bus driver, we would adopt a system of equal basic liberties and wealth that **work to the advantage of the least well-off members of society**
### Critique: Rawl's Theory
- What about natural talents and the need for incentives?
- What about efforts? 
- What about the rights/entitlements of people who worked hard?
# Week 4: International Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility
## Corporate Culture
- Shaped by the communications of values throughout the organisation
- Code of Conduct: a set of behavioural guidelines and expectations that govern all members of a business firm
- Mission Statement or credo: a formal summary statement that describes the goals, values, and institutional aim of an organisation
- A stronger ethical culture leads to better outcomes (less pressure, less misconduct, higher reporting, less retaliation, etc.)
- Successful companies often stick to a set of core values that are not compromised for financial gains or short-term expediency 
- Ambiguous culture leads t unclear decisions and public responses, especially when the law provides no answers, corporate culture could be a determining factor
## International CSR Framework
**General Framework**
- UN Global Compact (2000)
- UN Protect, Respect, Remedy Framework (2008) and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Rights (2011)
- ILO Tripartite Declaration (1977)

### Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact
**Human Rights**
- Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and
- Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses

**Labour**
- Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;
- Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;
- Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and

- PROTECT: **Governments** should protect their citizens from human rights abuses, including by business
- RESPECT: **Companies** have a responsibility to respect human rights
- REMEDY: Victims of Human rights abuses should have access to **judicial and non-judicial** remedies
### UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011)
- Corporate responsibility to respect HRs exists independently of, and as a complement, to states duties to protect human rights
- "Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they **should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights** of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved"
- In order to meet their responsibility to meet human rights, business enterprises should have in place **policies and processes** appropriate to their size and circumstances, including: 
	1. A **policy commitment** to meet their responsibility to respect human rights; 
	2. A human rights **due diligence** process to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how they address their impacts on human rights;
	3. Processes to enable the **remediation** of any adverse human rights impacts they cause or to which they contribute
### International Labour Organisation (ILO) Tripartite Declaration
1. **General Policies**: Encouraging businesses to contribute to economic and social progress while minimising any negative impacts on labour
2. **Employment**: Employment promotion, Social security, Elimination of forced or compulsory labour, Effective abolition of child labour, Equality of opportunity and treatment, Security of employment
3. **Training**
4. **Conditions of work and life**: Wages, benefits, and conditions of work & Safety and health
5. **Industrial relations**: Freedom of association and the right to organise, Collective bargaining, Consultation, Access to remedy and examination of grievances
### OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
- Observance of the Guidelines by enterprises are **voluntary** and is not legally enforceable
- Chapters on disclosure, employment and industrial relations, environment, information disclosure, combating bribery, consumer interests, science and technology, competition, taxation
- 2011: new chapter on human rights based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

**National Contact Points (NCPs)**
1. Initial assessment. NCP evaluates whether the issues raised merit further examination and either accepts the case or publishes a statement explaining why it has not accepted the case
2. Support. NCP offers its "good offices" (dialogue, mediation, conciliation services) to both parties with a view to resolving the issues
3. Conclusion. At the end of the process, the NCP publishes a statement regarding the issues raised in the case, the support offered by the NCP and the outcomes
## Ethics and the Notion of Responsibility
### Dimensions of Responsibility
> Responsibility dimensions are constantly changing, e.g. instances shifted from God to society/own conscience/humanity
#### Who? 
Refers to the subject of responsibility (the actor). Traditionally the focus was on individuals. Increasingly a collective is held responsible
- **Difficulty**: Within a collective many or several individuals are responsible. Assigning individual responsibility within a group is more difficult because responsibility is shared but not necessarily the same. The hierarchy within groups create different degrees of responsibility - depending on role and area of responsibility
#### What?
Refers to the object of responsibility (the area of action). Someone is responsible for their actions (including omissions) and the resulting intended and unintended consequences and collateral consequences
- **Difficulty**: For consequences new questions arise: for which consequences am I responsible? Are intention and predictability conditions for responsibility? Am I allowed to act at all if the consequences are unforeseeable?
#### To whom?
Refers to the instances to which someone is held responsible. These instances can be formal institutions, such as courts of law, or informal institutions, such as God, one's own conscience, society, humanity, nature, etc.
#### When?
Refers to the timing of the action. Responsibility can be **retrospective**. i.e., "being held responsible for". The subject justifies himself for an action retrospectively. Responsibility can also be **prospective**. In the sense of "feeling responsible for something". The subject of responsibility actively assumes responsibility in advance by, for example, refraining from actions with potentially negative consequences. 
#### Why?
Refers to the justifications for responsibility, or the question of the standard of responsibility. 
- *Standard of responsibility* means the normative frame of reference of responsibility
- Responsibility is based on **values** as a normative orientation concept
- This normative frame of reference provides an **evaluation criteria** for actions
- Responsibility justifications are therefore **values, norms, commandments, and principles**
- Different philosophers give different answers to the justification question e.g., 
	- Immanuel Kant: We are responsible because we are autonomous and free
	- Hans Jonas: We are responsible because we have freedom of choice and the ability to choose between alternative courses of action
	- David Hume: Responsibility is a moral feeling\
## Milton Friedman versus Stakeholder Capitalism
### Ethics and Business
**Milton Friedman: "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits**"
Friedman claimed that "there is one and only one social responsibility of business - to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud"
#### Criticism of Friedman
A completely different way of seeing business is to consider **business as part of society** - not separate to society. 
As such acceptable standards of business behaviour are drawn from society rather than having opposing standards within business and society
- Business is both responsible to society and responsible for society
### Stakeholder Capitalism (WEF)
"Stakeholder capitalism is a form of capitalism in which companies seek long-term value creation by taking into account the needs of all their stakeholders, and the society at large" - WEF
1. The purpose of a company is to **engage all its stakeholders** in shared and sustained value creation. In creating such value, a company serves **not only its shareholders**, but all its stakeholders - **employees, customers, suppliers, local communities and society at large**. The best way to understand and harmonise the divergent interests of all stakeholders is through a **shared commitment** to policies and decisions that strengthen the long-term prosperity of a company
2. A company is more than an economic unit generating wealth. It fulfils human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system. Performance must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it achieves its environmental, social, and good governance objectives. **Executive remuneration should reflect stakeholder responsibility**
3. A company that has a **multinational scope** of activities not only serves all those stakeholders who are directly engaged, but acts itself as a stakeholder - together with governments and civil society - of **our global future**. **Corporate global citizenship** requires a company to harness its core competencies, its entrepreneurship, skills, and relevant resources in collaborative efforts with other companies and stakeholders to **improve the state of the world**
## What is Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)?
### Salient Attributes of CSR
1. Responsible / ethical conduct (ethics and moral responsibility and accountability as constituting the core of CSR)
2. Balancing competing (and, at times, conflicting) aims and aspirations of diverse stakeholders (i.e., often involving cross-sectoral involvement and partnerships with business, society, and government)
3. Positive non-financial outcomes in addition to generating profits (i.e., the triple bottom-line considerations of environmental, social, and governance success)
4. Sustainability (i.e., embracing quality of life, environmental sustainability) 
5. Generally voluntary in nature and over and above what the law requires
### CSR v ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Difference
|               | CSR                                                 | ESG                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**  | A form of self-regulation. Doing well by doing good | Concept used by investors to evaluate a business's corporate behaviour and determine the future of its financial performance |
| **Benefit**   | Loyalty of employees and customers                  | Accessibility to capital and the cost of capitall                                                                            |
| **Audiences** | Consumers, employees, communities, NGOs             | Primarily: investors, potential investors, financial media, benchmark and indices (MSCI, SASB, etc.)                         |
| **Result**    | Reputation                                          | Risk management, financial, (increasingly) impacts                                                                           |
### Benefits of CSR form a business perspective
1. Increase employee satisfaction (operations efficiency)
2. Improve public image (strategic branding)
3. Increase customer loyalty (increased revenue base)
4. Increase creativity (human and intellectual capital)
5. Increase long-term sustainability and reduce costs (better access to capital)
6. Increase business ability to comply with regulation (lower business risks)
## Corporate Culture
- Shaped by the communications of values throughout the organisations
- Each organisation has a culture fashioned by a shared pattern of beliefs, expectations, and meanings that influence and guide the thinking and behaviours of the members of that organisation
#### Compliance-based cultures (traditional)
>  Code of Conduct: a set of behavioural guidelines that govern all members of a business firm
- Compliance with law and regulatory requirements
- Minimise risks of litigation and disputes
- Enhance accountability mechanisms
#### Value-based cultures
>  Mission Statement or credo: a formal summary statement that describes the goals, values, and traditional aim of an organisation
- A set of values: reliance on the personal integrity of the workforce
- Broader application: brand/reputation, recruiting/retaining talents, working environment, sustainability
- Codes of conduct based on a statement of values
### Corporate Culture, Leadership, and the Development of Mission and Code
- **Strong corporate culture can account for 20-30% differential in financial performance** over companies without strong culture
- Successful companies often stick to a set of **core values** that are not compromised for financial gains or short-term expediency (e.g. Wells Fargo)
- **Leadership** is crucial
- Ambiguous culture leads to unclear decisions and public responses, especially when the law provides no answers, corporate culture could be a determining factor
- Code of Conduct is Not Just "Print, Post, and Pray": It should be used and implemented. Communications/reporting mechanisms to help build ethics into culture: internal and external incentives
- Leaders should model the act, encouraging reporting, not covering up wrongdoing
- Be sensitive, in a globalised context
	- Do the code/programs align with local standards?
	- How deep can the code reach out to your supply chain?
	- Should you consult trade unions in the jurisdictions you operate before formulating these codes?
# Week 5: International Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility
### Global Value Chains (GVCs)
- refers to the cross-border organisation of the activities required to produce goods or services and bring them to consumers through inputs and various phases of development, production, and delivery
- to stay competitive, enterprises increasingly organise their production globally, breaking up their value chains into smaller parts supplied by a growing number of providers located worldwide. International sourcing of business functions is a key feature of GVCs
- also known as global supply chains
## Employment Relationship
### How to Identify Ethical Issues
- defined as situations that occur as a result of a moral conflict, a moral uneasiness, or a moral anxiety that must be addressed. Thus, ethical issues tend to interfere with someone's principles and values or with the principles and values of a society
- ethical issue is thus to be distinguished from an ethical dilemma
	- also called ethical paradoxes or moral dilemmas are situations which an agent stands under two conflicting moral requirements, none of which overrides the other
> moral anxiety can be described as a feeling of uncertainty about the correctness of a moral decision you are contemplating

#### Potential ethical issues in a employment relationship
- Unethical leadership
- Discrimination
- Sexual harassment
- Improper use of company time and resources
- Unsafe working conditions
- Exploitation
## Downsizing
Definition: The reduction of human resources at an organisation through termination, retirement, corporate divestment, or other means. Downsizing occurs when a firm makes a decision to fire many workers at once

Why is it done?
- Improve efficiency (by replacing employees with machinery)
- Reduce costs
- Rightsize resources relative to market demand
- Take advantage of cost synergies after a merger
- Increase profits by reducing overhead costs
- Responds to a decline in demand for the company's products or services
## Fair Wages
### Labour Unions
A labour union is an organisation formed by workers in a particular trade, industry, or company for the purpose of improving pay, benefits, and working conditions. Officially known as a "labour organisation", and also called a "trade union" or a "workers union", a labour union selects representatives to negotiate with employers in a process known as collective bargaining. When successful, the bargaining results in an agreement that stipulates working conditions for a period of time.

In the past unions have successfully fought for:
- shorter workdays
- better and safer working conditions
- minimum wage / wage increase
### Health and safety
**Sweatshops** is a factory or workplace where employees face poor working conditions, physical and verbal abuse, get paid extremely low wages, and work strenuous hours

Basic principle: workers must be protected from sickness, disease and injury arising from their employment
### Child Labour
often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. It refers to work that:
- is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children, and/or
- interferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school, obliging them to leave school prematurely; or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work
> Whether or not particular forms of "work" can be called "child labour" depends on the child's age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed, and the objectives pursued by individual countries. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries

The **worst forms of child labour** involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and/or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities often at a very early age

Whilst child labour takes many different forms, a priority is to eliminate without delay the **worst forms of child labour** as defined by the International Labour Organisation: 
- **All forms of slavery** or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and **trafficking of children**
- **Prostitution and pornography **
- The use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities
- Work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to **harm the health, safety or morals of children** (hazardous child labour)
#### Hazardous child labour
Hazardous work activities which should be prohibited it given by work which exposes the children to **physical, psychological or sexual abuse**
- work underground, under water, at dangerous heights or in confined spaces
- work with dangerous machinery, equipment and tools, or which involves the manual handling or transport of heavy loads
- work in an unhealthy environment which may, for long hours or during the night or work where the child is unreasonably confined to the premises of the employer
#### Global Governance Gap Thesis
1. Multinational companies active, through subsidiaries or indirectly, in developing countries 
2. Human rights/labour violations occur
3. States obliged under international human rights/labour law to ensure compliance of businesses in their territory
4. However in reality: Absence of enforcement of human rights/labour law on multi-national companies or their local subsidiaries/contractors
##### Lack of Governance in the Host State
1. Weak laws and regulations
2. Weak enforcement
	- Absence of capacity: weak institutions
	- Absence of will: corruption
	- Conflict affected areas
## Contexts, Law, and Tension 
**Different contexts (e.g. nations, regions) and different views: No one-size-fits-all approach**: fair labour standards of Europe and the United States are not the same

**Law (of states), contracts (negotiated by parties), and beyond (e.g. social media)**
- International: OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, UN Global Compact
- National: Singapore Prevention of Corruption Act, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
## Employment, Relationship, and Beyond
- Working conditions (e.g. health, safety): Domestic operation and abroad
- Due process in the workplace
	> The right of due process = the right to be shielded against the arbitrary exercise of authority
- Workforce represented by unions
- Treatment of employees concerns workplace harmony and productivity
### Supply Chain Responsibility
- Supply chain exploitation
- Due diligence
- Stakeholders
- The role of the government 
## Challenges
- Interest
- Contexts, including states, SMEs, MNEs
- Knowledge/expertise/education
- Poverty
- Different interpretation
- Complexity
# Week 6: Advertising and Marketing Ethics
## Advertising
- A form of mass communication
- Commercial product involved
- An element of choice that the communication brings to the consumer
#### Actors
- Advertising firms
- Advertising copywriters and advertising practitioners
- Endorsers of products and services
- Regulators
- Consumers, NGOs, and other actors
### Criticisms of Advertising
- Destroys choices/autonomy
- Manipulation of actual interests and needs
- Materialism/consumerism (including the idea that happiness can be bought)
- Utilitarianism v. Kant
#### Ethical Issues in Advertising and Marketing
1. Deceptive advertising
2. Irrational persuasion
3. Subliminal advertising, product placement, and advertorials
4. Stereotypes and prejudices in advertisements
### Deceptive Advertising
- Advertising is about information but also about persuasion and brand creation
- Chan (p.191): "If an advertisement makes a (verifiable) false claim, which the advertiser knows to be false, for the purpose of misleading, misinforming, or deceiving potential customers, then the advertisement is immoral"
- Metaphorical statements are not deceiving, yet what about mixing (factual) information with metaphorical statements?
- The category of deception
	- False statements
	- Perceived misrepresentations
	- Cases of half-truths
### Irrational Persuasion
- Persuasion as the starting point 
- Persuasion is not about manipulation nor coercion
- **Manipulation is often associated with trickery or exploitation; it is to take unfair advantage of persons by exploiting their deep seated emotions or sense of perceptions**
- A threat to autonomy?
	- Playing on natural natural human desires for security, acceptance, and self-esteem
	- Using powerful visual images rather than the written word to bypass rational thought process
	- Intruding into everyday life -> "cumulative psychological impact" that undermines our ability to function as free agents
#### The Morality of Persuasion
- For Immanuel Kant autonomy is fundamental (we can make moral decision only in the state of autonomy)
	- Undermining or influencing people's autonomy to sell a product or services (i.e. people are used as a means to make money) would not be morally right according to Kant
- For utilitarians using people is not a problem as long as the consequences are the greatest good for the greatest number. But what if this is not the outcome?
	- Sugary drinks, sugary children's cereal, tobacco, etc.
	- Attitudes (such as consumerism) or self-image (such as distorted concept of beauty) encouraged by marketing campaigns
- Virtue ethics: would a virtuous person/company persuade people to do things that harm them, or persuade people to buy things that are not in their interest or that they do not need?
### Subliminal advertising, product placement, and advertorials
- Challenge to autonomy, choice and consent in the free market
- By making people buy products they really do not need or desire, advertising may act contrary to the consensual nature of such transactions
- Counter-argument:
	- People want to be "taken in"
	- Evidence would be that not everybody is persuaded
	- Humans have a capacity to reason (but is this always the case?)
### Stereotypes and Prejudices in Advertisements
- Does advertising implicitly affect consumption patterns, cultural norms, and beliefs?
- Are advertisements morally responsible for such stereotypical and prejudicial views portrayed in the advertisement?
## Marketing
- is a broader undertaking than advertising
- includes the additional steps that need to be taken before a product or service can be made effectively available to the consumer
	- **Product**: Preproduction market research
	- **Pricing**: Setting an "appropriate" price
	- **Promotion**: Best way to promote a certain product
	- **Place**: Designing appropriate retail models
Two maxims:
- Caveat emptor -> buyers have full responsibility
- Caveat venditor -> the responsibility is placed on the seller to fully reveal the quality of the good
#### Ethical Issues
Product
- Life-cycle responsibility & planned obsolescence
- Product safety
- Labelling
Pricing
- Predatory pricing
- Price fixing
- Price gouging
Promotion
- Market research and psychological targeting of customers
- Direct marketing, e.g., to professionals like doctors
Place
- Marketing to vulnerable groups, e.g., children, the elderly, the poor
### Issues Caused by Advances in Technology
Magnifies existing marketing and advertising issues and causes other issues, such as:
- Invasion of privacy and misuse of personal information due to:
	- Hacking
	- Monitoring and/or exacerbated by data collectors selling your info to marketers
- Use of computer algorithms which reinforce human prejudices
- Online harassment/"doxxing"
- Online defamation, cyber-bullying, gambling, pornography
- Terrorist recruitment and spread of propaganda
### Codes of Conduct and Consumer Protection Law
- Consumers need to be able to obtain accurate, unbiased information about the products and services they purchase
- This enables them to make the best choices based on their interests and prevents them from being mistreated or misled by businesses
**Consumer protection laws** are made to protect consumers from fraudulent business practices, defective products, and dangerous goods and services
- SG Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act
- SG Unfair Contract Terms Act
### Ethical advertising and marketing
- Ethical advertising is about truth, fairness, and equity in messaging and consumer experience
- An ethical advertisement is honest, accurate, and strives for human dignity
- An ethical advertisement considers the advertising environments that are chosen for placement, and it examines potential for data bias in analytics
# Week 7:  Ethics and Technology (Social Media)
### Hate Speech vs. Free Speech
- Hate speech encompasses communication that vilifies or incites **hatred against individuals or groups based on attributes like race, religion, or sexual orientation**. It includes verbal, pictorial, and symbolic forms, such as swastikas or cross-burnings, raising debates about its harmfulness and whether it warrants legal restrictions
- In the U.S., hate speech enjoys protection under the First Amendment, emphasising free speech - "American Exceptionalism"
- Contrarily, other countries enforce laws against hate speech, prioritising dignity, respect, and equality. Not just free speech, but other social values
- This does not say that free speech is protected as an absolute right. Rather, it is just that the US places more weight on free speech protection compared to others
### Communication Decency Art and "Moderators Dilemma"
- Enables platforms to host and moderate content without being publishers
- Allows removal/moderation of harmful content without legal repercussions for each user post; likewise, no liability even if doing nothing
- Only some exceptions
- Facilitates the free flow of information online; essential for internet growth and development
### "Marketplace of Ideas"
- suggests that ideas compete freely in public discourse, much like goods in a market. This concept is often associated with John Stuart Mill, who, in his work, "On Liberty", posits that **through open debate and competition, the best ideas will emerge and prevail, contributing to the discovery of truth and the advancement of society**
- It underpins arguments for minimal restrictions on speech, advocating that a diverse array of voices and opinions promotes a more informed and democratic society
### Boundary of Free Speech
#### "Fighting Words" doctrine
- Words that tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace are excluded from the First Amendment protection. It prevents speech that could lead to immediate violence and public disorder
- Limitation: This applies to direct, face-to-face provocations that are likely to provoke a violent response. Over time, subsequent court cases have significantly narrowed the application of the doctrine, emphasising the importance of protecting freedom of speech and being cautious of broadly categorising speech as "fighting words"
## Laws 
### German Basic Law
1. Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing, and pictures, and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship
2. These rights shall **find their limits in the provisions of general laws**, in provisions for the protection of **young persons, and in the right to personal honour**
### EU Digital Services Act
Key Features
- Accessibility: legal responsibilities of online platforms on content moderation
- Transparency and reporting: requires online platforms to be more transparent about their content moderation policies and practices. Platforms must also establish clear and accessible mechanisms for users to report illegal content
- Notice-and-Action Mechanism: users notify the platform, and platforms are required to take actions within the prescribed timeframe
- Removal: DSA included provisions that require online platforms to promptly remove illegal content once it is reported and identified
### International Framework
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Principle 13(b):
- "The responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises: Seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts"
### Global Platform, Local Values, and Divergent Perspectives
Universal Standards in a Pluralistic World: An Ethical Dilemma
- Kant's categorical imperative suggests that actions must be based on principles that can be universally applied. In the context of content moderation, this raises questions about whether the principles that guide decisions on speech can be universally justified and how platforms can respect the intrinsic dignity and autonomy of all users
Utilitarianism?
- From a utilitarian perspective, which emphasises the greatest good for the greatest number, how should social media platforms balance the ethical imperative to protect free speech with the necessity to safeguard users from hate speech, misinformation, and other forms of harmful content? Whether the benefits of unrestricted speech outweigh the potential harm to individuals and communities
# Week 9: Technology Ethics
## Issue of Technology and Ethics
### Technology Changes, "Right" and "Wrong"
**Juan Enriquez**
- Our great-grandparents might be shocked by in-vitro fertilisation
- Our grand-grandchildren might be shocked by the messiness in pregnancy, childbirth, and unedited genes
### More Then Technology: Design and Hidden Power of New Tech
**Design-Driven Discrimination**
- Robert Moses' design choices in 1930-60s New York have had lasting discriminatory impacts. He intentionally designed Long Island Parkway overpasses too low for buses, isolating those reliant on public transport, predominantly the poor and people of colour. These designs still cause issues today.
### Ethical Theories, Challenges, and Solutions
Challenges
- "Digital ethics shopping"
- Urgency (e.g. energy consumption of tech), unpredictability, silos (e.g. technology, law, environment)
- Knowledge and digital divide 
- Different societies/values of different cultures
- Difficulties in promoting international collaboration
	- AI's reach across borders, digital sovereignty, geoeconomies, technical capacity, representation...
Solution: Are existing solutions sufficient?
- Examples: Precautionary principle, ethics guidelines (e.g. transparency, justice, accountability, privacy, respect for human autonomy and dignity)
### Ethical Challenges
- Electronic waste
	- Not enough recycling 
	- E-waste in developing countries (human health impacts)
- Consumer protection 
	- Cell phones and cancer risks?
- Bioethics and technology: Is interfering with nature ethical?
	- Artificial prolongation of life
	- Genetic enhancement
	- Stem cells and cloning
	- etc.
## AI and Ethics
- **Unemployment**: what happens after the end of jobs?
- **Inequality**: How do we distribute the wealth created by machines?
- **Humanity**: How do machines affect our behaviour and interaction? 
- Artificial stupidity: How can we guard against mistakes?
- Racist robots: how do we eliminate AI bias?
- Security: How do we keep AI safe from adversaries?
- Evil genies: How do we protect against unintended consequences?
- Singularity: How do we stay in control of a complex intelligent system?
- Robot right: How do we define the humane treatment of AI?
### Case Study: AI principles
Who makes them?
- Private films, governmental agencies, academic and research institutions, intergovernmental or supranational organisations, non-profit organisations and professional associations/scientific societies...
- Legitimacy (e.g. deregulation, lobbying, and marketing for self-governance, or hands-off governance), transparency...
## Driverless Technology, AI, and Ethics
### Ethical Issues of Driverless Technology
**Pros**:
- Increased mobility for seniors and disabled
- Increased road safety 
- Sustainable mobility (e-vehicles)
**Cons**:
- Safety hazards for road users
- Vulnerability to cyberattacks
- Health risk caused by microwave radiation?
- Any environmental implications (e.g. driverless car batteries)?
- Lack of regulation (e.g. issue of liability)
# Week 10: Environmental Ethics
## Hans Jonas
### Future Ethics
- Jonas sees ecological risks of technological progress
- Common feature of all livings being: Existential concern for their own existence 
- That means: All life in nature strives for self-preservation
- From this Jonas deduces that not only humans have dignity but the whole existing nature
- From this Jonas derives a moral claim to integrity of nature, which humans also claim for themselves. Hence, we have the duty to treat nature respectfully and with care
- Jonas' thinking was influenced by acute challenges of the 20th century
- He sees his ethics as an "ethics of necessity"
- Traditional ethics are no longer sufficient. His ethics is meant to supplement, not replace, traditional ethics
- The subject of responsibility is now not only the individual but the collective
- Space and time perspective must be expanded: No longer only the manageable area (with foreseeable effect) but global: world and universe
- Present responsibility is extended to **future responsibility**
- Currently living people (in the immediate environment), so it is now people worldwide and **future generations**
> We have a moral duty to treat nature respectfully and carefully, for the sake of future generations
### Ecological Imperative
"Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life"
"Act so that the effects of your action are not destructive to the future possibility of genuine human life"
> Genuine human life > With this, he means that it is not only about physical survival but about "real human life" = humanity, morality, compassion, respect

### Heuristic of Fear
- Starting point: Modern science and technology can have unforeseeable and potentially devastating consequences
- **Heuristic is the process of finding good solutions with limited knowledge and little time**
- **Fear understood as anticipatory worry can be the guide to make good decisions**
- **Heuristic of fear in the consideration of action alternatives: one should assume the worst case imaginable and act accordingly**
- According to Jonas, the pre-conceived danger should provide orientation for responsible action
- Reversal of the burden of proof: Not the dangerousness of research or a technology must be proven, but its non-dangerousness
- For Jonas, concepts such as risk, impact assessment, and side effects gain ethical significance
- A heuristic of fear can prevent progress. But according to Jonas the risks of progress are more serious than the chances
- According to Jonas, it is no longer about progress, but about a human-dignified life (genuine human life)
- The freedom of science must end where the value and dignity of nature are violated
> Advocates for a **cautious approach to technological innovation**, emphasising responsibility the **long-term effects on humanity and the environment**. It uses **fear** as a preventive measure to guide decisions amid uncertain risks, promoting caution and assuming worst-case scenarios. **The burden of proof is shifted, requiring proof of safety rather than danger**. This approach calls for thorough risk assessments to protect human dignity and environmental integrity and decisions should prioritise the preservation of human dignity, considering **potential future implications**
### The Precautionary Approach/Principle
In essence, the precautionary principle is the idea that environmentally sensitive activities should be avoided, and precautionary measures taken, where there is potential hazard but scientific uncertainty as to the impact of the environmentally sensitive activity

The precautionary approach places the responsibility on decision-makers to demonstrate that a particular actions is not harmful before proceeding
## Sustainable Development Agenda
Sustainable development means: development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
![|600](images/Pasted%20image%2020240415205455.png)
## Climate Change
### SDG 13: Climate Action
Two main dimensions:
- **Mitigation** by preventing and minimising the causes of climate change
- **Adaptation** by anticipating and taking measures to deal with the damages caused by climate change
### Paris Agreement
- Limit global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius but effort aimed at 1.5 degrees Celcius by the end of the century
- To achieve this, the world must be Net-Zero by 2050
- National climate plans increasing level of ambition: Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
- Five-year evaluation ('global stock-take')
- Financial support for developing countries
## Climate Justice
"Climate justice" entails ensuring representation, inclusion, and protection of the rights of those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Solutions must promote equity, assure access to basic resources, and ensure that young people can live, learn, play and work in healthy and clean environments (UNICEF)
### Key Points of Climate Injustice
- Different responsibility of industrialised countries and non-industrialised countries 
- Corporations not taking enough responsibility
- Unequal distribution of impacts on development countries
- Unequal distribution of impacts on a variety of groups, including indigenous people, people of colour, women and disabled people
- Generational injustice: Unequal distribution of impacts on future generations
### Climate Change Litigation
Recent case law highlights many moral arguments that are made by claimants, such as: 
- Inter-generational equity and responsibility for future generations
- Responsibility towards nature and the planet
- Basic rights are infringed if the climate crisis is not solved
# Week 11: Ethics and Finance
### Examples of Ethical Issues in Finance
- Financial institutions being complicit in fraud or not undertaking due diligence
- Conflict of interests of investment bankers, managers, brokers, etc.
- Manipulation of inter-bank lending
	- Banks exchange funds to facilitate the flow of funds to the most profitable investment projects. Lending is limited to a specific term and subject to an interbank interest rate
- Money-laundering (of funds generated by embezzlement, bribery, fraud, gambling, etc.)
- Executive compensation (high executive salaries not linked to a company's performance)
### Banks and Corruption
- Money-laundering of funds generated by corruption
- Banks accounts of corrupt politicians, dictators and criminals
- Kleptocrats and other criminals need the bankers to park their "stolen money" safely and secretly
- Prevailing culture in the banking sector: short-term profit maximisation
- Should banks be the gatekeepers to the global flows of dirty cash?
### Ponzi Schemes
- a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors. The Ponzi scheme generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors
- Unethical because it involves unscrupulous investors taking advantage of unsuspecting individuals by promising them extraordinary returns in exchange for their money
### Insider Trading
- Illegal insider trading involves the buying or selling of securities (shares of a company) based on 'material, non-public information' about those securities (or about the financial condition of a company)
- Insider trading involves information that if known to the public, would likely affect the market price of financial products or is likely to influence a reasonable investor to subscribe for, buy or sell these products
- Unethical because it gives the insider an unfair advantage, puts the interests of the insider above those to whom he or she owes a fiduciary duty, and allows an insider to artificially influence the value of a company's stocks
## 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC)
- Many banks around the world incurred large losses and relied on government support to avoid bankruptcy. Millions of people lost their jobs as the major advanced economies experienced their deepest recessions since the Great Depression in the 1930s
- Recovery from the crisis was also much slower than past recessions that were not associated with a financial crisis
- To boost the economy, the US Fed cut the interest rates rapidly but became the lifeblood of the housing boom
**Two Major Reasons**: 
1. 'Sub-prime lending' to individuals who wanted to own homes
	- Bankers and other actors in the financial sector
	- Irresponsible mortgage lending, losing track of risk
	- Regulators did not act in time...
2. The packaging of 'securities' at major banks based on mortgages of dubious value
	- Investors bought them relying on the problematic ratings given by credit rating agencies
	- Housing slump...
#### Excessive Risk-Taking and Over-Optimistic View of the Resilience of the Economy
- Before the GFC, there was optimism that the economy was strong and resilient. Expectations of ongoing robust economic performance and rising house prices led to excessive borrowing by consumers, investors, and banks
#### Predatory Lending, Lack of Ethics/Regulatory Oversight
- Banks did not properly assess the borrower's conditions and often gave mortgages to those who could not sufficiently meet the repayments if economic conditions changed
### The Economist (2013) "factors at work"
- These packaged mortgages were used to back something called "collateralised debt obligations" (CDO)
- Investors bought these "collateralised debt obligations" relying on the triple A ratings given by credit rating agencies
- Then there was a nation-wide housing slump that led to a dramatic fall in property prices. The mortgaged-back securities collapsed in value
- Lehman Brothers went bankrupt
- Trust in the financial system began to dissolve
### Failure to Properly Regulate & Neoliberalism
- Investors also failed to understand the complexity and risk of these financial products
- Institutions and the MBS packages were not properly regulated, which often led to misleading behaviour and fraud
- Credit rating agencies continued to rate the MBS packages as safe products, which were, in reality, very risky. These agencies did so because they were often paid by the firms that packaged the loans
### Conflicts of Interests, CRAs, and GFC
- CRAs assess the creditworthiness of entities and financial instruments, influencing investor decisions
- Mis-rated Securities: Leading up to the GFC, CRAs assigned high ratings to risky mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)
- **Conflict of Interest**: CRAs were compensated by the entities they were rating, creating a financial incentive to provide favourable ratings. The fee-based model cultivated a culture of issuing higher ratings to attract more business, misleading investors the true risk
- Impact: Investors, misled by these inflated ratings, poured funds into risky assets, contributing to the overvaluation of assets. While the true risk was realised, asset values plummeted, exacerbating the GFC's impact
- Lack of Transparency and Competition: The rating industry, dominated by three major CRAs, suffered from a lack of competition and transparency, further enabling his conflict of interest
- Response: Post-GFC, regulatory bodies have aimed to mitigate such conflicts by enhancing oversight and promoting competition and transparency in the credit rating industry
## Pay Day Loan
- Accessibility: Provide immediate financial relief for those with poor credit history or low income
- High-Interest Rates: Often comes with exorbitant interest rates and fees, potentially trapping borrowers in a debt cycle
- Regulatory Gaps: Varying levels of regulation across jurisdictions allow for the continual operation of payday lending, sometimes with little oversight
- Financial Inclusion vs. Debt Trap: Fill a critical gap by offering financial resources to the underserved, yet the long-term debt implications can be severe
- Reflection: Regulations, financial education, and alternative lending models could mitigate risks while maintaining the inclusivity aspect - what's the role of banks in terms of these financially marginalised citizens from ethical/CSR perspective
### "Ethics and Finance - Aligning Financial Incentives with Societal Objective" Christine Lagarde
- Aftermath of financial crisis: need to build a more ethical and resilient financial system
- Questioning the role of distorted incentives in fuelling excessive risk taking -> change of culture
**Key areas**:
- **Compensation**: Incentives related to compensation practices need to change, so that rewards are no longer so much tied to excessive risk-taking
- **Governance**: Internal control and risk management of institutions. Better oversight of the board on management
- **Corporate culture and individual accountability**: Shift from rules-based behaviour to value-based behaviour
- **Financial deepening, inclusion, and stability**: Instability when financial sector development outpaces the strength the supervisory framework. Hence, need for global regulatory frameworks
## Greenwashing
**Misrepresentation and Deception**
- Greenwashing an unethical practice, involves falsely portraying financial products as environmentally friendly to capitalise on the growing demand for ESG investments

**Detrimental Implications**:
- Misleads investors seeking to make ethically responsible choices, thereby undermining the integrity of ESG financial markets and diluting genuine efforts towards sustainability

**Solutions? Regulation, Education, and...?**
- Implementing stringent regulations and enhancing investor education can help combat greenwashing, promoting a more authentic and ethical ESG financial landscape
# Week 12: Vocational and Professional Identity and Ethics
### Professionals
- Professionals profess to know better than other actors the nature of selected matters, and to know better than their clients that ails them or their affairs (the essence of the professional idea and the professional claim)
- The professional claim has many consequences:
	- Exclusive right to practice, a vocation, the arts which he/she professes to know, and to give the kind of advice derived from his/her special lines of knowledge
	- Basis of a license: legal permission + certain social leeway
	- The professional asks to be trusted
- "Credit emptor" means that the client is not a true judge of the value of the service, and the fact that the best professional advice might not always solve the problem
- Stakeholders include professional bodies
### What does Professional Identity Mean?
- is the concept which describes **how we perceive ourselves within our occupational context and how we communicate this to others**
- Having a strong professional identity **enables us to consider our values and how they relate to the behaviours that are expected of us by profession, our colleagues and patients**  
### Professional Ethics and Role Morality
- "**Role morality** involves acts which professionals would personally regard as unethical but which they would nevertheless consider permissible only because they see themselves as acting in the best interests of their employer or client" Chandra Mohan
### Role-differentiated Morality vs Integrated Morality
**Role-differentiated morality** refers to situations in which one's moral response will vary depending upon whether one is acting in a personal capacity or in a professional, representative one

**Integrated morality** describes how rules, values, and virtues are interconnected and how Integrity therefore draws upon all these ethical facets. 
### Fiduciary Duties
- A legal duty, grounded in trust to act on behalf or in the interest of another
- Professionals have an obligation (a duty) to their - clients, students, patients - rooted in trust, to act on behalf or in the interest of another
## Lawyers, Doctors, Teachers, and Members of a Board of Directors
### Lawyers
- An advocate and solicitor has duties to different parties that may sometimes conflict with each other
#### Sources of ethical duties
1. Legal Profession Act and subsidiary legislation (e.g., Legal Profession Rules/professional conduct rules)
2. Practice Directions
3. Guidance Notes issued by Law Society, Courts, or government agencies
4. Case law
#### Professional Conduct Rules (Singapore)
- A lawyer owes a **paramount duty to the Court** which takes precedence over his duty to his client
- To uphold the laws of Singapore
- To be fair and courteous towards every person in respect of his professional conduct
- To facilitate access to justice by members of the public
- To keep up to date with all pertinent developments in the lawyer's area of practice
### Doctors
- Misconduct can often lead to damaging consequences (physical and mental)
- Code of Ethics for medical professionals
	- Hippocratic Oath
	- Singapore Medical Council Physicians' Pledge
	- World Medical Association (WMA) International Code of Medical Ethics
### Members of a Board of Directors
- **Duty of care**: Involves the exercise of reasonable care by a board member to ensure that the corporate executives with whom he or she works carry out their management responsibilities and comply with the law in the best interests of the corporation
- **Duty of good faith**: Requires board members to be faithful to the organisation's mission. In other words, they are not permitted to act in a way that is inconsistent with the central goals of the organisation
- **Duty of loyalty**: Requires board members to give undivided allegiance when making decisions affecting the organisation. This means that the conflict of interests must always be solved in favour of the organisation
## Conflict of Interest 
A situation in which an entity or individual becomes unreliable because of a clash between personal (or self-serving) interests and professional duties or responsibilities

Conflict can occur in the following situations:
- Biased judgement
- Direct competition
- Misuse of position
- Violation of confidentiality
Examples
1. **Law**: especially judges/arbitrators lose their independence and impartiality, which undermines the proper functioning of justice
2. **Business**: CEOs and board members can experience a conflict of interest between short-term stock value and long-term corporate interests
## Whistleblowing
- **A whistleblower** is a person, often an employee, who reveals information about activity within a private or public organisation that is deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe, or fraudulent. Whistleblowers can use a variety of internal or external channels to communicate information or allegations (e.g. external whistleblowing)
- Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) Framework
	- Platform for individuals to disclose any observed improprieties (...) without fear of reprisal
	- All instances of whistleblowing will be independently reviewed and investigated by an audit committee
	- "Whistleblowers should report their concerns in **good faith**". The whistleblower's identity and concerns raised will be kept confidential, unless as requested by the law (...)
- Internal channels: An effective whistleblowing policy of institutions (eg firms) promotes their commitments to ethical conduct
	- Internal channels for reporting
	- Protection of whistleblowers
- External channels (eg government agencies responsible for investigating relevant issues)
- Issues (documentary evidence, confidentiality of whistleblowers and whistleblowee identity)
- Law, cultures, attitudes, and beyond
	- National Law (eg Japan's Whistleblower Protection Act that covers both private and public sector)

# Week 13: Medical Ethics
## Principles of Medical Ethics
### Autonomy
- The principle is set for the practice of "**informed consent**" in the physician/patient connection or transaction regarding health care
- It is the basis understanding that in the relations between individuals in a given situation there must be autonomy on the part of the moral decision-maker
	- **Decision-making**: the ability to make rational decisions, especially when considering one own's future. Truly moral decision incorporate respect for the patient's own desires and needs
	- **Respect for individuals**: most patients have limited medical knowledge and might be too frightened by their illness. Hence, caregivers must encourage and respect patients
#### Patient's rights
- **Refusal of treatment**: A patient who is competent to give consent is also morally entitled to withhold treatment for whatever he or she deems sufficient. This is true even if refusing treatment may result in serious harm or death. Physicians should, however, assess the reasons of noncompliance since often the reasons involve failures of communication, lack of trust in the physician or psychologic factors
- **Treatment of terminally ill patients**: Patient who are terminally ill and whose death is imminent may decide against life-support care that serves only to prolong the process of dying
### Beneficence
- The medical profession has a responsibility to do good for patients and the public
- This responsibility may be exercised through care of individual patients or through efforts directed to preventing or ameliorating health problems in a community
- Beneficence includes all efforts to increase the health of a community
### Non-maleficence
- The duty to "do no harm"
- To kill is morally not acceptable
### Justice
- Procedural justice
- Distributive justice
- Physicians must consider it the treatment with the law, the patient's rights, and if it is fair and balanced
### Fidelity
This is the duty to observe pledges made by the profession to society and to individual patients. The two key promises are:
1. Truthfulness
	- Telling patients the truth
	- The truth can hurt. The physicians should weigh between telling and not telling now and wait for a more opportune time
2. Confidentiality
	- Limiting information to those who have a legitimate need
	- Avoiding idle conversation about patients
	- Using initials or other names when presenting cases in conferences or teaching
	- Medical confidentiality is not absolute. Revealing information may be legally required
## Medical Ethics and AI
Potential ethical issues
- The potential for AI to make erroneous decisions;
- Who is responsible when AI is used to support decision-making;
- Difficulties in validating the outputs of AI systems;
- The risk of inherent bias in the data used to train AI systems;
- Ensuring the security and privacy of potentially sensitive data;
- Securing public trust in the development and use of AI technology;
- Effects on people’s sense of dignity and social isolation in care situations;
- Effects on the roles and skill-requirements of healthcare professionals; and
- The potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes.
## Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide
##### Euthanasia
is the intentional act of ending the life of a person, typically to relieve them of suffering due to a terminal illness or an incurable medical condition

This act is carried out by a healthcare professional or another individual, with the explicit intention of causing the person's death
##### Assisted suicide
involved providing a person with the means or information necessary to intentionally end their own life. Unlike euthanasia, in assisted suicide, the person takes an active role in the act of ending their life, with assistance form a healthcare professional or another individual

This assistance may come in the form of providing medications or other means, along with guidance on how to use them for the purpose of ending their own life
## Abortion
#### Conservatives
- The embryo is a human being with the same rights because at conception the embryo receives its own unique genetic code, distinct from that of its mother (main argument coming from religious circles)
- A secular argument: it is wrong to kill because killing deprives the victim of a valuable future
#### Liberals
- Biological humanity is neither necessary nor sufficient for personhood. Only the killing of persons is wrong;
- Persons have sentience, consciousness, capacity for rational thought, language; 
- No one has the right to use another body unless given permission (at least in the case of rape, the woman has not given the fetus the right to use her body)
- A pregnant woman may have duties of care to others, such as her existing children (Many pregnant women regard bringing a child into the world unethical when they are unable to care for it properly)
#### Moderate
- Embryo is not a person
- However, the late-gestation fetus merits some moral concern because it is virtually identical to a born infant
- Hence, reasons that justify an early abortion would not justify a later abortion in the 7th month
## Mandatory Vaccination
**Ethical Issues**
- Autonomy versus health and well-being of public
- Necessity
- Proportionality
- Reasonableness of the measure, including scientific evidence, and safety
- Justice in access and availability
- Public trust
- Precaution
### Limits to Autonomy
"Public health may be invoked as a ground for limiting certain rights in order to allow a state to take measures dealing with a serious threat to the health of the population or individual members of the population"

These measures must specifically be aimed at preventing disease or injury or providing care for the sick and the injured
